By default, Wordpress is an extremely secure system. However, it is also is open to an enormous amount of vulnerabilities which are disclosed publicly on numerous different websites as they are found. That's where FraudGrade comes in, to save you from potential Wordpress exploits and spam.

In addition to securing a Wordpress website against 0-Day Exploits the plugin can also easily mitigate most types of hacking attempts via brute force, CSRF, LFI, SQLi, XSS and etc. 

The plugin can also be used to deter most types of spam such as comment spam, xml-rpc spam, admin area spam, login attempt spam and etc. By clicking just a few checkboxes you can have your site secured in less than 5 minutes. 

If you are having a high rate of spam and other fraudulent activities from certain countries the plugin will prove useful in your scenario. Configure any and all countries to be blocked from reaching your Wordpress installation and even redirect them to an entirely different URL if required.
